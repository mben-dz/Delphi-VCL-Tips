<summary>Tip1: Improving GPControls(StyleControls) Rendering Performance ðŸŒŸ</summary>

 **Problem:**  
  If you're experiencing flickering, freezing, or slow rendering when using GPControls (especially with TscGPButton or similar controls from the StyleControls library) in your Delphi applications, try these tips!.

 **Solution:**  
 After experimenting with various optimization techniquesâ€”such as:

- Enabling double buffering  
- Tweaking WM_PAINT/WM_ERASEBKGND handlers  
- Integrating Direct2D for hardware acceleration  

I discovered a **simple yet effective solution**: **Embed your GPControls on a `TIKPageViewPage` (from the `TIKPageView` IMageKit Component).**
  
## Why This Works  

- **Optimized Rendering Context:**  
  `TIKPageViewPage` is designed with an optimized drawing surface and efficient buffering. This minimizes the cost of invalidation and redraw operations.

- **Efficient Resource Management:**  
  The page view pre-allocates and manages resources better than a standard form, reducing the overhead when rendering GPControls.

- **Reduced Flicker and Overhead:**  
  Better internal strategies for handling paint messages result in a smoother, more responsive UI.
  

## How to Implement

1. **Integrate `TIKPageView` into Your Application:**  
   - Add the `TIKPageView` component to your form.

2. **Create a `TIKPageViewPage`:**  
   - Within `TIKPageView`, create a new page (i.e., a `TIKPageViewPage`).

3. **Place Your GPControls on the Page:**  
   - Move all your GPControls (e.g., `TscGPButton` and others) from the main form onto the `TIKPageViewPage`.

4. **Test the Performance:**  
   - Run your application and observe a significant reduction in flickering and freezing during dynamic operations (like form resize).

  
## Final Thoughts

This approach has dramatically improved the rendering speed in my applicationsâ€”almost like magic! If you're facing similar issues with GPControls, give this method a try and enjoy the enhanced performance.

Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have improvements or additional insights to share.

Happy coding!
